du: disk usage
 --> It shows the disk size of a specific folder and all its subfolders
 --> du -h inhere/



xargs
 --> It takes input (usually from stdin) and builds and executes command lines from that input. (so in case of | it receives the output from pipe and pass it as arguments to the passed command such as rm or file)
 --> find . -type f | xargs rm    // removes all the files returned by find



file
 --> It returns the type of a file not just by looking for the extensions
 --> file ./-file01



find: recursively searches for files and directories
 --> returns a list of paths with a specific pattern
 --> find . -type f -name "*.conf"   // returns all paths with .conf extension in the current directory and all its subdirectories
--> Some Actions:
	-exec: allows us to run a command on every result returned by find, i.e., find . -type f -exec ls -l {} \; where {} is a placeholder for the current file that find is processing and \; ends the -exec command (must be escaped!). Note: use + instead of \; which executes the command once per batch (passes multiple files at once).
	 



grep: searches texts within a file
 --> returns all lines with a specific pattern in a file or passed input
 --> grep "dynamic" /etc/proxychains.conf  
 --> find . type f | grep ".text"   // returns all paths with the pattern .text from the output returned by find



locate
 --> same as find but searches within a pre-built database (not useful for real-time manipulation)
 --> locate --all "passwd"
 --> locate /etc --all "passwd"



chown
 --> it changes the ownership of a file (Sets user and/or group)



sort
 --> Sort lines of text files or standard input alphabetically
 --> sort -n numbers.txt   //sort numerically
 --> sort -k2 -n data.txt   //sort numerically according to the second column
 --> sort -u data.txt    //remove duplicates and sort



uniq
 --> Filter out repeated lines from input. Itâ€™s often used after sort, because uniq only removes consecutive duplicate lines.
 --> uniq -d data.txt   //shows only duplicated lines
 --> uniq -u data.txt   //shows only unique lines  
 --> sort data.txt | uniq  //should be used in this way



strings 
 --> Extract readable text (printable ASCII or Unicode strings) from binary files (like executables, compiled programs, or dumps). It scans a file and pulls out all sequences of printable characters (usually 4 or more characters long), which are likely to be human-readable text hidden inside binary data.
 --> strings data.txt
